# Contributing

English · [简体中文](CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md)

## Before you start

- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `docs/specs/git-conventions.md` §2–§4.
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.ai.md` when AI assisted the change.
- One change = one batch = one PR.

## Flow

```text
branch -> commit -> PR -> review -> merge
```

- Do not push to `main`.
- Keep a branch short-lived.
- Fill the PR template; no placeholders.
- Required checks must pass before merge.

## Review

- The author does not self-approve. If the author is an AI, a human signs off.
- Review the diff, the tests, and the evidence.
- A waiver is recorded, not agreed verbally.

## Merge

- Merge with `gh pr merge --squash`; never push to `main`.
- A squash merge of several commits takes `--subject` and `--body-file`; the
  body is generated with `python infra/tool/merge/pr_merge.py`, never typed by
  hand. The rules, and the two mistakes already in history, are in
  `docs/specs/git-conventions.md` §4.
- After merging, run `python infra/tool/merge/pr_merge.py --verify-only`; §4
  says what it reads and why nothing else checks that commit.
